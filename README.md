Propagator: MATLAB-based Optical System Propagation Simulation.
</H1>

Most of this code was written by and owned by Alexander T. Rodack and Justin M. Knight, PhD candidates at the University of Arizona.  

Zernike functions in Utilities were written and provided by Ruslan Belikov and Jared Males.  

To install, download or clone the Propagator repository. Then add the directory to the MATLAB path.

The code is still under development. More explanation will be added here once the code reaches a good settling point.

Currently supported branch: v0.2.
