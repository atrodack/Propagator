Propagator: MATLAB-based Optical System Propagation Simulation.
</H1>

Most of this code was written by and owned by Alexander T. Rodack and Justin M. Knight, PhD candidates at the University of Arizona.  

Zernike functions in Utilities were written and provided by Ruslan Belikov and Jared Males.  

Phase Screen code inspired by Johanan Codona. He has some great code at https://github.com/jlcodona/AOSim2. 

cprintf is written by Yair Altman (see license.txt in cprintf folder) and obtained via MathWorks File Exchange at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24093-cprintf-display-formatted-colored-text-in-the-command-window. 

To install, download or clone the Propagator repository. Then add the directory to the MATLAB path. See Issues tab for file path considerations.

The code is still under development. More explanation will be added here once the code reaches a good settling point.

Currently supported branch: v0.2.
Currently reworking structure a bit in branch v0.2_beta.
